I decompose the problem in 3:

- The wish to piss off the perpetrator. Cathartic justice. May not give back the moments of pains that the victim endured but might feel good after all :).

- Making sure the perpetrator does not do it again and/or to somebody else.

- Helping/warning/gathering potential other victims. As soon as possible.

The two last ones are probably the ones on which most victims would prefer to focus on. Yet, I realized how the current system of "justice" is absolutely not made for it when I saw this talk:

I wish there was more systems thought like that, and international databasis too as polices stop at borders but rapists do not. Today I found out that there is one guy that created recently a system of "match" to put victims in contact with each others in france (coabuse.fr). I find it so cool. I put the name of the person as well as the name of other predators I know (more minor like a random hand on your butt etc.). I am datascientist... That feels good to think that their name and actions is in a database somewhere.  Mostly symbolic.  But who knows damocles sword may fall? :)
